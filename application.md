# Please link to a program you've written from scratch

Other than minor open source features and bug fixes, everything I've written is closed source for the companies I've worked for. So I wrote the Database Server for the pairing interview (with the in-memory database, of course).

# What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

After World War I, there were American (and British and French and other) troops fighting on the White side in the Russian Civil War until at least 1920. They originally went there during WWI after the revolution to safeguard war material they'd sent Russia for the war. Yet they stayed after the armistice. Shocker!

Of course I never learned this is in school in the US. This certainly would have explained a ton about the Russia mistrust of the US.

What's pretty wild about this is that one of the reasons the allied powers gave up was because too many troops were defecting to the Red side.

# What do you want to be doing in two years?

Traveling the world and writing [home cooked apps](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) for myself, family, and friends.

I might instead be writing software for an organization that is a net positive in the world. I was doing that the past six years, writing firmware for Citibike's bikes. After donating to organizations fighting for safer streets, it was wonderful being paid to help get more people on bikes.

And given what I've learned about Recurse Center, I expect to continue to be involved. It seems like a great place.

# Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

In my semi-retirement, I want to write programs for myself and my family. I've always worked on teams, and even when I'm the sole member, I've always had other people to bounce ideas off of. I can use my time at recurse to have the support of people around me, but also train myself to be doing things on my own.

Also, throughout my career, I've always thought that my most important job was making sure everyone around me is succeeding, and I miss that already. I hope that I'd be able to 

# What would you like to work on at RC?

I want to teach myself modern Swift and write a Bluesky iPad app that I'd want to use. With my experience working on the Facebook iPhone app infrastructure 8 years ago, I have pretty good ideas about the structure of how best to do it. But the language and UI are a mystery for me to solve. Ideally, along with help from my fellow recursors.

# Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?

This would be in-person. And given why I want to recurse, I'm hoping that everyone would be in-person.

I live an easy 15 minute subway or bike ride away, just up the hill in Prospect Heights.

# Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

I accidentally took an Intro to CS course in a summer program in High School in 1982, and realized that this is what I want to do forever. I graduated college in 1987 and have been programming professionally since then.

My first five years, I wrote software controlling machines over serial ports, starting with a machine growing GaAs crystals, ending with displaying scores on character generators for NBC at the Barcelona Olympics. 

The next 25 years, I wrote software that just talked to other software, at various investment banks and Internet companies. The difficulty level increased, but I grew with it.

The past 6 years, I've been closer to my roots writing firmware for bikes and scooters at Lyft. I'm writing at the lower level as I did back in the 80s, but with much more experience, and better tools.

# Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

See above. :P

# Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

Technically, CMU didn't offer a CS undergraduate degree in 1987, but I have the closest they offered (Applied Math with a track in Computer Science).

# What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

I have no other commitments. My kids are in college. I have taken my September lay-off as a sign that I maybe should be retired, and I am lucky enough to afford it.

At worst, if I decide that I do want to go back to work, I might have some interviews at the tail end. But I truly see this as the best thing I should be doing for myself right now.

# How did you first hear about RC?

# How long ago did you first hear about RC?

September 2024.
